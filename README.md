# Car-Sales-Analysis
In this repository, I've analyzed the sales data of an international car dealer and created an interactive dashboard. This dashboard consists of 4 interactive visuals: Total Car Sales, Total Sales by Country,
Top 3 Car Models, and Total Sales. By using the timeline labeled "Order Date," I've added the ability to view specific time periods, updating the interactive graphs in real-time. Additionally, since the timeline
only allows for date filtering, I've added 3 slicers to filter by color, country, and whether or not the car was financed. Finally, I've also added an indepedent graph called Total Sales by Color to show that
graphs can be synced or unsynced from the filtering slicers and timeline.
